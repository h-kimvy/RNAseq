RNA samples: All RNA samples were extracted from Scots pine roots in different treatment conditions. Each treatment has three biological replicates.

This analysis: RNA samples were obtained from Scots pine roots incubated with Suillus luteus (Sl) - a mutualistic fungus can offer a buffering protection against pathogen attacks and promote nutrient access and water uptake by enhancing root growth through its influence on gene expression. RNA samples in the mutualistic group (Sl1, Sl2, Sl3) were analysed with RNA samples in the Control group (Ctr1, Ctr2, Ctr3).

Comparison with other treatment group: RNA samples were obtained from Scots pine roots inoculated with Heterobasidion annousm (Ha) (one-month infection) - a pathogen can cause root and stem rot disease. RNA samples in the infected group (Ha1, Ha2, Ha3) were analysed with RNA samples in the Control group (Ctr1, Ctr2, Ctr3).
Aims of this analysis:

- Investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups: Sl and Control.

- Compare the list of DEGs between different conditions analysed with the control groups: Sl and Ha.
